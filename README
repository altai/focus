After installing RPM edit /etc/focus/local_settings.py.
You'll need to:
- have running Memcached server (MEMCACHED_HOST default to '127.0.0.1:11211')
- set credentials to Keystone MySQL db for read-only user (RO_DATABASE_URI)
- set credentials to Keystone MySQL db for read-write user (RW_DATABASE_URI)
- set credentials to Invitations MySQL db (INVITATIONS_DATABASE_URI)
MySQL database for invitations must be loaded with dump from /etc/invitations_dump.sql on install. Update for now does not require any actions.

- set URL to access ODB (NEO4J_API_URL)
- set Keystone access configuration dictionary (KEYSTONE_CONF):
 * auth_uri - Keyston authentication URL for port 5000 
 * admin_tenant_name - usually 'systenant'
 * admin_user - usually 'admin'
 * admin_password - Keystone password for admin_user
 * admin_tenant_id - ID of admin_tenant_name tenant
- set SMTP server configuration (MAIL_SERVER, MAIL_PORT)
- set default uploads destination (UPLOADS_DEFAULT_DEST)
- set difference between Focus and Keystone timezones (RELATIVE_TO_API_HOURS_SHIFT)
